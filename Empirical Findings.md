### 4. Empirical Findings 📊🔍

#### 4.1 Measures of Model’s Performance 📈

To evaluate how well our model predicts currency returns, we use two key performance measures: **Total R-squared (R²)** and **Predictive R-squared (R²)**.

**Total R-squared (Total R²) 📊**
- **Definition**: This measure tells us how much of the variation in currency returns our model can explain using both the beta coefficients (sensitivity to factors) and the actual values of the factors.
- **Example**: If our Total R² is 80%, it means our model can explain 80% of the changes in currency returns. This indicates a good fit.
- **Layman Explanation**: Think of Total R² as a measure of how well your recipe explains the taste of a dish. If it’s high, your recipe is doing a great job at predicting the taste based on the ingredients.

**Predictive R-squared (Predictive R²) 🔮**
- **Definition**: This measure tells us how well our model can predict future currency returns using past data.
- **Example**: If our Predictive R² is 10%, it means our model can explain 10% of the future changes in currency returns based on historical information.
- **Layman Explanation**: Predictive R² is like predicting how well a new batch of cookies will turn out based on past baking experiences. It shows how reliable your recipe is for future batches.

#### 4.2 Model’s Performance: In-Sample vs. Out-of-Sample Tests 🧪🔄

We evaluate our model's performance in two different periods: in-sample (first ten years) and out-of-sample (last three years).

**In-Sample Performance (Training Period) 🏋️‍♂️**
- **Definition**: This is the period where we train our model using historical data.
- **Example**: If we train our model using data from 2008 to 2017, this is the in-sample period.
- **Findings**: The Total R² for PCA is generally higher than for IPCA, indicating PCA fits the historical data better. However, PCA might overfit, meaning it’s too tailored to the training data and may not perform well on new data.

**Out-of-Sample Performance (Testing Period) 📅🔍**
- **Definition**: This is the period where we test our model using new data that wasn’t used during training.
- **Example**: If we test our model using data from 2018 to 2020, this is the out-of-sample period.
- **Findings**: The Predictive R² for IPCA is often positive, suggesting it can predict future returns better than PCA, which typically has negative Predictive R², indicating poor predictive performance.

**Comparing In-Sample and Out-of-Sample Performance 📊🔄**
- **PCA vs. IPCA**: PCA might look better during training (higher Total R²) but doesn’t predict future returns well (negative Predictive R²). IPCA, on the other hand, balances fitting historical data and predicting future returns better.
- **Example**: If you have two cookie recipes, PCA might be great for your initial batch (training), but when you try it on new ingredients (testing), it fails. IPCA, while not perfect in the initial batch, performs better with new ingredients.

#### 4.3 Economic Significance Based on the IPCA Predictions 💼📈

**Trading Strategies Based on Predictions 📊💹**
- **Definition**: We use the predicted returns from the IPCA model to create trading strategies. If the model predicts a currency will go up, we buy that currency (long position). If it predicts a drop, we sell that currency (short position).
- **Example**: If the IPCA model predicts the euro will rise, we buy euros. If it predicts the yen will fall, we sell yen.
- **Findings**: The IPCA model generally outperforms PCA in both full-sample and out-of-sample periods, meaning it provides better trading signals.

**Full-Sample vs. Out-of-Sample Returns 📅🔍**
- **Full-Sample Period**: The entire data period from 2008 to 2020.
- **Out-of-Sample Period**: The testing period from 2018 to 2020.
- **Findings**: The IPCA model shows higher returns in the out-of-sample period, indicating it’s better at predicting future returns compared to PCA.

**Portfolio Performance 📈📉**
- **Equally-Weighted Portfolio**: We create a portfolio by equally weighting the returns of all ten currencies.
- **Findings**: The IPCA model yields better returns than PCA. While PCA might show some good fits during training, it doesn't translate to actual economic gains when tested with new data.

**Comparative Performance of IPCA and PCA 📊⚖️**
- **Losses and Gains**: While PCA might show losses in some currencies, IPCA generally performs better across different currencies.
- **Example**: If the PCA model loses money with the Swiss franc, but the IPCA model makes money, it shows the IPCA model’s better prediction capability.

**Visual Comparison 📊🔍**
- **Graphs and Charts**: We use bar plots to compare the cumulative returns of the IPCA and PCA models. Positive values indicate better performance by IPCA.
- **Findings**: The IPCA model outperforms PCA in most currencies, especially in the out-of-sample period, highlighting its robustness and better predictive power.

### Key Takeaways 📝

- **Total R²**: Measures how well the model explains historical data. Higher for PCA during training, but IPCA catches up with more factors.
- **Predictive R²**: Measures how well the model predicts future returns. Generally positive for IPCA, indicating better future predictions.
- **In-Sample vs. Out-of-Sample**: IPCA performs better in predicting new data, avoiding overfitting issues seen with PCA.
- **Economic Significance**: IPCA provides better trading signals, leading to higher returns in both full-sample and out-of-sample periods.

Certainly! Here's a quick insight into how models like the ones described (e.g., IPCA) are deployed in real-time by hedge funds, outlining the basic process once a strategy is found:

### 1. Strategy Development and Backtesting 🔍📈
