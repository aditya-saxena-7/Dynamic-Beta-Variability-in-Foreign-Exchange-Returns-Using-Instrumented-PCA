## **Introduction:**

Hello everyone! 🌟 My name is Aditya, and I'd like to share some interesting findings from my research on how exchange rates (the value of one currency compared to another) change over time. 📉📈 I used a special method called Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) to make sense of a lot of complex data. My research has shown some cool results that can help us better predict currency prices. This research won 2nd prize at the Undergraduate Research and Innovation Competition (URC) in 2022, a prestigious national-level competition. 🏅

**About URC:**
The URC is the largest undergraduate research event in the entire GCC and MENA region, targeting all major disciplines. Last year, over 3000 research papers were presented from 27 disciplines by teams representing universities from 17 participating countries from across the region. 

### **Abstract:**
Predicting currency prices is like trying to predict the weather 🌦️—it's really tough! One reason is that the usual way of predicting assumes some key numbers (called beta coefficients) don't change over time ⏰. But guess what? They do! We used a special math trick called Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) 🧩 to make sense of lots of data from different countries. Our new method did a better job at predicting than the old methods 🚀. We found out that things like medium-term interest rates, stock market trends 📊, and unique market movements 🌀 are super important for making accurate predictions.

### **Key Terminologies:**

1. **Foreign Exchange Market (FX):** This is where currencies are bought and sold. Think of it as a big marketplace where people trade money from different countries 💱.

2. **Beta Coefficients:** These are numbers that tell us how much a currency's price might change in response to changes in other factors 📈. Traditionally, they were assumed to stay the same over time, but we found out they actually change.

3. **Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA):** A fancy math method that helps us look at lots of data at once and find patterns 🧩. It's like having a super-smart assistant who can quickly spot important trends.

4. **Medium-term Interest Rate Differential:** The difference in interest rates between two countries over a medium period, like a few months or years. This can influence currency prices 📊.

5. **Stock Market Momentum:** This refers to the trend or direction in which the stock market is moving. If stocks are generally going up or down, it can affect currency prices 📉📈.

6. **Idiosyncratic Volatility:** Unique, unpredictable changes in the market that can affect currency prices 🌀.
