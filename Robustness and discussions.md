### 6. Robustness and Discussions 📊💬

In this section, we evaluate how robust our findings are by examining currency excess returns and discussing the limitations of our study.

#### 6.1 Currency Excess Returns 💵📈

**Definition of Currency Excess Returns 📋:**

**Currency Excess Return 📉➡️📈**
- **Definition**: Currency excess return refers to the return on a currency investment above a risk-free rate. The risk-free rate is typically the return on a safe investment, like a US Treasury bill.
- **Example**: If you invest in euros and earn a 3% return while the risk-free rate is 1%, your currency excess return is 2%.

**Key Concepts and Their Importance 📊:**

1. **Risk-Free Rate 💼🔒**:
   - **Definition**: The return on an investment that is considered free of risk, usually government bonds or Treasury bills.
   - **Example**: A US Treasury bill yielding 1% is often used as the risk-free rate.

2. **Interest Rate Parity 📉📊**:
   - **Definition**: A theory that suggests the difference in interest rates between two countries should equal the expected change in exchange rates between the countries' currencies.
   - **Example**: If the interest rate in the US is 2% and in the UK is 4%, the pound is expected to depreciate by 2% against the dollar to maintain parity.

**Analysis of Currency Excess Returns 🔍:**

**Performance Metrics 📏**:
- **Average Excess Return**: The average return of the currency investment above the risk-free rate.
- **Standard Deviation**: Measures the volatility or risk of the currency excess returns.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: A measure of risk-adjusted return, calculated as the average excess return divided by the standard deviation.

**Findings 📊:**
- **Consistency**: Our model's predictions of currency excess returns are consistent over time.
- **Risk-Adjusted Performance**: The Sharpe ratio is generally higher for our model, indicating better risk-adjusted returns.

**Real-World Example 🌐:**
- **Investment Decision**: Suppose you invest in the Japanese yen with an expected excess return of 2% and a Sharpe ratio of 1.5. This means you can expect to earn 2% above the risk-free rate with a relatively good balance between risk and return.

#### 6.2 Limitations of Our Study 📉⚖️

While our study presents promising results, it’s essential to acknowledge its limitations. Here are some key limitations and their implications:

**Key Limitations and Their Explanations 📋:**

1. **Model Assumptions 📊🔄**:
   - **Definition**: Our model makes several assumptions about the factors affecting currency returns and their relationships.
   - **Example**: We assume that certain economic indicators like interest rates and stock market momentum are the primary drivers of currency returns.

2. **Data Limitations 📅📉**:
   - **Definition**: The quality and availability of data can affect the accuracy of our model.
   - **Example**: We use data from 2008 to 2020, but changes in data collection methods or missing data points can impact our findings.

3. **Market Conditions 🌍📉**:
   - **Definition**: The model's performance may vary under different market conditions.
   - **Example**: The model might perform well during stable economic periods but may not predict accurately during extreme market volatility, like the 2008 Financial Crisis.

4. **Out-of-Sample Performance 🔮📊**:
   - **Definition**: While our model shows good out-of-sample performance, it’s based on historical data and may not guarantee future performance.
   - **Example**: Economic events not reflected in the historical data, like future pandemics or geopolitical shifts, can impact model accuracy.

**Discussion on Limitations 🔍💬:**

**Understanding the Impact 📉**:
- **Assumptions**: Acknowledging that our model's assumptions might oversimplify the real-world complexities.
- **Example**: Assuming interest rates alone drive currency returns might miss other important factors like political stability or technological advancements.

**Data and Market Conditions 📊**:
- **Data Quality**: Emphasizing the need for high-quality, comprehensive data for more accurate predictions.
- **Example**: Better data collection methods and access to more recent data can improve model reliability.

**Future Research Directions 🔬🔮**:
- **Improving Models**: Suggesting ways to refine the model by incorporating more diverse factors or using more sophisticated techniques.
- **Example**: Including factors like consumer sentiment or global trade dynamics in future models.

**Real-World Example 🌐:**
- **Investment Strategy**: While our model provides useful insights, investors should be aware of its limitations and complement it with other analyses and market intelligence.
